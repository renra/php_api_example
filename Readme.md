# PHP API Example

This is a small project for a job evaluation. It has no db support, all is stubbed. It requires PHP cURL to run integration tests. On Debian you can install that by running:

```
apt-get install php5-curl
```

## Seeing output in the browser

```
ln -s /path/to/your/clone/dir /var/www/ #or some other location you use for serving files
```

Then you can navigate your browser to localhost/php_api_example/ and see some output coming from within the micro-app.
